# Layered Architecture Backend

## 📘 Project Description

**Layered Architecture Backend** is a backend project that demonstrates the implementation of a layered architecture pattern in a Node.js application. This project is designed to structure the backend in a modular and scalable way, separating concerns into distinct layers such as the controller, service, and data access layers. This architecture ensures maintainability, scalability, and reusability across different parts of the application.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Separation of concerns**: Organize the backend into clear layers with specific responsibilities.
- **Scalability**: Allow the backend to grow and manage new features as the application expands.
- **Maintainability**: Improve the code maintainability by organizing logic into services and controllers.
- **Modularity**: Create reusable components and services that can be shared across the application.

## 🧱 Project Architecture

This project follows a typical **Layered Architecture** and is divided into the following layers:

- **Controller Layer**: Handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and sends the appropriate response.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and interacts with the data access layer to perform operations.
- **Data Access Layer**: Responsible for interacting with the database using an ORM or direct queries.
- **Model Layer**: Contains the data structures and schemas used to represent data in the database.

## 🗂️ Key Folders and Components

### 📁 `src`

- **Controllers**: Handles HTTP requests and responses. Controllers are used to define routes and process requests.
  - Example: `UserController`, `PostController`
  
- **Services**: Contains business logic and service methods that interact with the database.
  - Example: `UserService`, `PostService`
  
- **Models**: Defines the structure of the data used in the application.
  - Example: `UserModel`, `PostModel`
  
- **Database**: Configurations and scripts for connecting to and interacting with the database.

### 🧰 `Services`

Services manage the core functionality of the application, and interact with the database. Key services include:

- **UserService**: Manages user-related operations like registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **PostService**: Manages blog post-related operations like creating, editing, and fetching posts.

### ⚙️ Configuration

- **Database Configuration**: Defines the settings for connecting to the database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
- **Environment Variables**: Stores sensitive information like API keys, database URLs, etc.

### 🛠️ Used Technologies

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for building the backend.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL**: Database used for storing data.
- **Mongoose** (if using MongoDB) or **Sequelize** (if using SQL databases): ORM tools for database interaction.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For authentication and authorization.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
